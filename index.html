        <p>Spotigen started as an idea for my AP Computer Science A project. I was tasked to make something that included natural language processing,
            which is the act of taking human language, and performing functions to make the computer do something. Most people made a simple autocomplete, 
            but I wanted to be ambitious. I set off to make a spotify playlist generator. However, I wasn't able to complete the project, as I had to use the 
            wrong programming language. So I made this, seperately, because I couldn't just give up on my project.

        <p>I am Evan O'Keefe. At the time of making this I am a Junior at Poway High School. I am passionate about programming and game development. 
            I started programming in 7th grade, when I taught myself C# and Unity. I now know 6 different programming languages, and have made many projects. 
            In my free time I enjoy playing video games like Need For Speed, Counterstrike, and Fortnite, and playing music on guitar or ukulele.
